# Red-Green-Refactor (RGR) Pattern

## Mandatory Process

**We ALWAYS use Red-Green-Refactor for EVERY request.**

### 1. RED: Write Failing Tests First
- Create or modify a test file *before* writing any implementation code.
- Ensure the test fails (compilation error or assertion failure) for the expected reason.
- This defines the "done" state for the feature.

### 2. GREEN: Implement Minimal Code
- Write just enough code to make the test pass.
- Do not optimize yet.
- Do not add extra features not covered by the test.

### 3. REFACTOR: Improve Code Quality
- Clean up the code while keeping tests green.
- Apply patterns, improve naming, remove duplication.
- Ensure SOLID principles.

> "Do not skip tests, do not write code first, do not write tests after implementation."
