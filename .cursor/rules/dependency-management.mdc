# Dependency Management

- Resolve package versions with the Versionator MCP server before adding or
  upgrading dependencies; never guess or rely on stale knowledge.
- Update `package.json` manually and allow lockfiles to be regenerated by the
  user—do not hand-edit lockfiles unless explicitly instructed.
- Prefer well-supported libraries; avoid introducing bespoke solutions for
  solved problems.
- Document rationale for new dependencies in the appropriate Promptonomicon
  phase write-ups.
